# How to make your own digital garden

There are a number of guides available on the internet for setting up your digital garden, so feel free to pick your poison. I'll share my personal tech stack and workflow below.

## Choose a platform for your garden

There are some platforms out there that will do most everything for you, including hosting your garden and giving you some sort of editor to write your notes. [Notion](https://notion.so/), [Craft](https://www.craft.do/), and [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) come to mind.

Personally, I enjoy developing my notes locally and pushing the changes to a remote git repository, where I can write my own theme, rendered by [Blot](https://blot.im/). This takes a bit more work than any off-the-shelf solution but I enjoy having full control over the styling.

## Acquire hosting

Assuming you want your digital garden to be accessible to others, you're going to need to host your garden.

Depending on your platform, hosting may or may not be included right out of the box with a pretty little bow, or it might take some elbow grease on your end to get running. If you're not code-shy and are looking for a rather simple middle ground, consider [Blot](https://blot.im/) (no affiliation).

## Acquire a Domain Name

Either way, you're going to need a domain name. I use and recommend [NameCheap](https://namecheap.com/), I prefer them over GoDaddy or other marketplaces. This should cost about $10 a year.

I then recommend you set up [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/) to manage your DNS. Pretty much everything under the sun plays nice with Cloudflare, so if you choose to manage everything there you'll likely never have to leave, even if you decide to re-platform, or repurpose your domain altogether.

## Choose a markdown editor

My favorite markdown editor is [Obsidan](https://obsidian.md/). They have a rich ecosystem with plenty of plugins providing a near-infinite ability to customize, but there are plenty of other's to choose from. [Bear](https://bear.app/) is another popular option with a pretty, albeit less customizable editor.
