# Welcome

Hey there! I'm Scott, and this is my digital garden ðŸŒ¿ â€”a relaxed corner of the internet where my ideas grow in public and insight gradually accumulates over timeâ€¦ from acorns to mighty oak treesâ€¦ you get the idea.

Unlike a traditional blog with an index, think of this place as a walk through a parkâ€”each path leading to several rabbit holes. Embrace the chaos and just jump in somewhere.

Navigating through my note archive is straightforward:

- Find out what I'm currently up to on my [[Now]] page.
- Find out what I'm thinking about on my [[Top of Mind]] page.
- Find answers to your questions on the [[FAQ]] page.
- Explore my list of [[Principles]].

Thanks for stopping by, and be sure to [reach out](mailto:scott@scotterickson.io) if you have any comments on what I have written here!

Scott.
